# Hospitality_Analytics_Dashboard

## Problem Statement‚ùó

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across india. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing it's market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. 

However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a Hospitality Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to provide hotel managers and decision-makers with real-time performance insights.

The dashboard enables monitoring of revenue, occupancy, booking trends, and property-level performance across different cities and categories (Luxury vs. Business).

It combines 20+ DAX measures to calculate and analyze KPIs that are critical for the hospitality industry.

## Key Metrics(KPIs):

- ***Revenue*** ‚Äì Total revenue generated from bookings.

- ***RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)*** = Revenue √∑ Total Available Rooms

- ***ADR (Average Daily Rate)*** = Total Room Revenue √∑ Rooms Sold

- ***Occupancy %*** = Rooms Sold √∑ Total Available Rooms √ó 100

- ***DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)*** ‚Äì Total rooms available to sell per day.

- ***SRN (Sellable Room Nights)*** ‚Äì Total room nights available across period.

- ***Realisation %*** ‚Äì Ratio of successful bookings (checked-in) vs total bookings.


## Important DAX Formulas

1. Revenue Formula

``` DAX
Revenue = SUM(fact_bookings[revenue-realized])
```

2. RevPAR Formula

```DAX
RevPAR = DIVIDE([Revenue],[Total_Capacity])
```

3. ADR Fomula

```DAX
ADR = DIVIDE([Revenue],[Total_bookings],0)
```

4. Realisation

```DAX
Realisation = 1-([Cancellation %]+[No Show rate %])
```

5. Occupancy Formula

```DAX
Occupancy = DIVIDE([Total_successful_bookings],[Total_Capacity],0)
```

6. DSRN ***(Daily Sellable Room Nights)***

```DAX
DSRN = DIVIDE([Total_Capacity],[No of Days])
```

**These formulas highlight how raw booking data is transformed into business KPIs for actionable insights.**
